  <h2>Research</h2>

  <h3>Publications</h3>
  Inevitably, my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U33dfecAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar page</a> will have the most up to date information about my publications. Please feel free to email me for copies of any of my work.

  <h3>Collaborations</h3>
  I am proud to be part of and/or work with the following research groups:

	<h4><a href='http://kastner.ucsd.edu'>Kastner Research Group @ CSE, UCSD</a></h4>
	The Kastner Research group focuses on the advancement of embedded technology. At a high level, this technology includes devices that seamlessly integrate into our lives and facilitate tasking on the consumer, corporate and research level through advances in low-level computing.

        <h4><a href='http://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu/'>Jaffe Laboratory for Underwater Imaging @ MPL, SIO, UCSD</a></h4>
        The Jaffe lab focuses on building oceanographic instruments for answering questions in marine ecology and physical oceanography. I specifically work with the <a href="http://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu/research-projects/autonomous-underwater-explorers/">Autonomous Underwater Explorers (AUEs)</a>

        <h4><a href='https://isterre.fr/recherche/equipes/waves-and-structures/'>Institut des Sciences De la Terr (ISTerre) - Waves and Structures @ Universite Grenoble, Alps</a></h4>
        ISTerre studies the physics of wave propagation through different media. I (spent/am spending) the 2016-2017 school year working with <a href="https://isterre.fr/annuaire/pages-web-du-personnel/philippe-roux/??id_auteur=61">Dr. Philippe Roux</a> working on a section of my thesis.

        <h4><a href='http://cisa3.calit2.net/'>Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art, Architecture and Archaeology (CISA3)</a></h4>
	CISA3 develops tools and technology for the discovery, documentation, preservation and dissemination of important Cultural Heritage sites. You can find my CISA3 profile <a href='http://cisa3.calit2.net/igert-teech/bio.php?id=68'>here</a>.


	<h4><a href='http://e4e.ucsd.edu'> Engineers for Exploration</a></h4>
	The Engineers for Exploration pushes the limits of both conservation research and exploration through the development of remote imaging technology.
