I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="http://ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a>. I work with teams to develop <em>remote sensing</em> and <em>robotic</em> technologies to understand phenomena in archaeology, ecology and physical oceanography. I gravitate towards problems in digital signal processing, although I also enjoy systems level development. Most of my recent efforts have been in marine environments and ambient noise processing.
